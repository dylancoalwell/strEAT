strEAT is a website that makes deciding where to eat easy. Ask a friend to lunch and strEAT will show you the places to eat that are on the direct route between you and your lunchmate. If you need to run errands but would also like to eat out, just put the address of your destination and strEAT will show you every available restaurant on your direct route.
